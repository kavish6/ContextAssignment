# This is a small project to demonstrate the working of ContextAPI in react. It is a simple Task List.

### Functioning

- Tasks are passed as context in the project
- To demonstrate the working of ContextAPI a new task can be added by using the add new task button and can be removed by a component at the same level i.e the remove task button.
- The task state can also be change by a component at an even lower level i.e the CustomTask component which allows the user to create a custom task.
